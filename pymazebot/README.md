# Introducing: (a)MazeBot!
## Davvott's little Noop that likes mazes.
Of course, you need:

* <code>Python 3.6</code>
* <code>pip install requests</code>

## Console Version:
Run pymazebot in your favourite console.
* WASD Controls
* Automated request to Noops HQ
* Backtracking for when you make a mistake!

## Automated MazeBot:
* Tested on small 10x10's, ironed out the kinks
* MazeBot is not efficient, but is reasonably fast!
* Need to streamline path finding logic for better decision making.
* Need to update Cardinal directions to basic offsets
